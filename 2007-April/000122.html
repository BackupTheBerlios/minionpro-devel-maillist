This might be unrelated, but I'm having the same problem with a book  
with Lucida fonts.

I use Gerben Wierda's teTeX distribution (pdfeTeX 1.30.4-2.2), Gerben  
Wierda's TeXLive distribution (pdfTeX 1.40.3-2.2) and TeXLive-2007  
(pdfTeX 1.40.3-2.2).

(As some may know, thanks to a Gerben Wierda-Jerome Laurens device,  
on MacOS X you can shift from one TeX distribution to another through  
a Preference panel.)

I have *all* my Lucida font files in my personal TeX branch in my  
HOME directory, so all of the above TeX distribution have to use  
exactly the same Lucida metrics, *.pbf, .sty, etc., files.

Now ---a 180 pages book typeset last may typesets exactly the same  
with GW's teTeX distro (updated 2007/01/03) but gives 184 pages with  
either GW's TeXLive or TeXLive-2007. There are simple differences, as  
words hyphenating differently (but both right), or major differences,  
as text flowing differently from one page to the next.

Before posting the issue to appropriate mailing lists (pdftex,  
texhax), I've been trying to isolate the problem using in both  
TeXLive distros the same package versions as in teTeX, but I haven't  
had any luck ---I'm starting to believe the worst: a pdfTeX issue.

Once I'm done trying with every single package the book uses, I'll  
post my findings to the mailing lists above, but seeing you have the  
same problem with MinionPro, I thought it might be worth to let you  
know.


Best,

Axel
