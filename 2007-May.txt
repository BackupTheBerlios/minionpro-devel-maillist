Subject: [Minionpro-devel] Too many files when compiling from source
Message-ID: <2257ea30705012019m45d3f851xdb8b2adfb0b89686@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I've got much more generated (tfm, vf, enc) files when compiling
MinionPro package from the source than one gets in the packed zip
files (enc-1.001.zip, metrics-*.zip) available from BerliOS, even
disabling the vietnamese metrics. For example, I've got 112 .enc files
named "a_xxxxxx.enc" plus a "mn-integral.enc" (none named
base-MinionPro-ax.enc) and twice (or more) the tfm files.
Consequently, the resulting MinionPro.map is absurdly huge. I follow
the procedure (makeall and install) described in the README in order
to compile the package sources downloaded from cvs? Does anybody know
what is going wrong, i.e., if something is going wrong?

TIA,

Bernhard Enders.


PS.: I was unable to compile MnSymbol, is the cvs structure of this
package broken? Where is, for example, the pfb directory?

Looks like it's not documented yet in the readme:
   Use the --pack option for makeall/maketfm, the glyphlist files are  
in the scripts subdirectory.

What do you mean by compiling MnSymbol? The pfb/otf are generated  
through the scripts provided in MnSymbol's CVS subdirectory. Did you  
modify MnSymbol's sources and now you need custom pfb/otf?

Best,
Michael

Ok. Now I used the option --pack="./scripts/glyph-list-1.001" and it
works fine for me, but unfortunately this seems to be the cause of
errors in the dvips render method of Yap (invalid vector<T> subscript
error) mentioned before in this list.

Is there any way to generate the glyph-list for a given font before
processing the metrics and everything else? I see that the
generate-glyph-list.sh script uses all post processing dvips/a_*.enc
files to accomplish this, even though the output is different
(smaller) from the provided glyph-list-* files.

Sorry, my fault here.

Thanks one more time,

In fact I'm still confused about what to change in the MinionPro
source files in order to support different Adobe Pro font families.
For example, a simple find and replace allows me to produce the
following test document using WarnockPro fonts:

http://www.bernhard.pro.br/pub/testmath_WarnockPro.pdf

Note that (on page 24) the \varrho symbol is missing. Maybe there is
need to change something else in the MinionPro.dtx? Any additional
help in this direction is welcome!

Thanks one more time,

Bernhard.

Which is a yap-bug. Both happening with MathTimePro and the new  
MinionPro RC3. Christian Schenk asked for a test case, would be nice  
if somebody could provide one.

None that I know of. Some post-processing of the glyphlist generated  
by 'generate-glyph-list.sh' may be in order so that all too wild  
jumping between base encodings can be avoided. I did this half- 
manually, see the enc-files of MinionPro's RC3 to get a rough idea.

I'll give it a closer look. Looks like the integral is taken from  
Janson, why? I'd suggest giving it a try with Warnock-LightItDisp  
with a slight negative slant but no expansion/compression for  
displayed integrals. Did you adapt the fontinst files so that \oint  
and friend are ok (in text and display style if used together with  
the equivalent of the minionint-option)?
Did you adapt the side bearings and accent positions already? They  
look ok at first sight.

This is done in scripts/maketfm-*.cfg, e.g. in maketfm-MinionPro.cfg by
   oml_flags="--unicoding 'rho1 =: rho'"
mapping rho to varrho. Better check all encodings with 'testfont'.  
See our scripts where we had to make extra efforts differentiating  
between font versions and upright/italic.

This was not intended, I think there is a bug somewhere in my Jenson
package related to the integral sign. I will give Warnock-LightItDisp
a try.

Yes, I do.

No changes needed here, as they (side bearings and accent positions)
look pretty good, IMHO. I think there is little work to do in order to
produce a WarnockPro+MnSymbol package based on MinionPro... and it's
worth. What do you think guys? (I'm spreading seeds hoping to reap
fruits!)

Bernhard.

Jenson package, that sounds interesting. Where did you take the Greek

BTW, are you aware of my Kepler MultipleMaster package?
   http://www.hft.ei.tum.de/mz/kepler_sample.zip
   http://www.hft.ei.tum.de/mz/keplerMM.zip
It uses mtpro2 for Greek letters and the symbols.

Not too interesting since there are not greek letters (as you mention)
and many other characters are missing from this "Pro" font family.

Message-ID: <2257ea30705040528i56558657xf4091bc6e5364f0e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I don't know why, but the currently provided files glyph-list-1.000,
glyph-list-1.001, and glyph-list-2.000 cannot be reproduced using the
script generate-glyph-list.sh, maybe those glyph files aren't up to
date with the generate-glyph-list.sh and need recreation.

More important is the fact that this seems to be the cause, according
to my experience, of the invalid vector<T> subscript error with
MinionPro and Yap! I have just created new glyph files using the
current generate-glyph-list.sh and recompiled MinionPro using the
--pack option point to the new glyph file and surprise: the Yap error
is gone forever!

Maybe someone else can confirm (reproduce) this report...

Best,

Bernhard.

They are up-to-date, the glyph list has been half-manually re- 
arranged so that each encodings isn't all too wildly scattered across  
different base encodings.
This also has the effect that the resulting pdf is smaller.

Odd. In miktex's bug tracker somebody mentions that this bug also  
appears with MathTime Professional2. I suspect that that it is really  
a yap bug as pdftex (in pdf mode), dvips, dvipdfm(x), xdvi all work  
without a problem.

> Maybe someone else can confirm (reproduce) this report...

Indeed, this is highly desirable. Even more if somebody can construct  
a test case for Christian Schenk of miktex. And, for the record, I  
don't have miktex at hand, so somebody please go ahead.

I have already supplied Christian with a simple test case involving
MinionPro that includes the original glyph-list-2.000 and another
glyph-list without all that /.notdef entries generated by
generate-glyph-list.sh after processing the fonts.

According to http://tinyurl.com/38kxch he's not happy with the test  
cases.

What do you mean by removing the /.notdef entries? Each base encoding  
needs to have exactly 256 entries, the remaining empty ones are  
filles up with /.notdef.

Those are old "test cases". I submitted a new one today.

I thought those /.notdef entries should be present only in the
resulting .enc file and not in the glyph-list, just a guess, I'm quite
new to all of this...

Subject: [Minionpro-devel] Replaced integral sign on new package installation
Message-ID: <2257ea30705062004m2385a3bdt6bbb02b4a9066e3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I'm trying to create some new font packages based on MinionPro source
code. One interesting issue I've noticed is that the integral sign is
taken from the most recent installed font package, while using the
$fontint option (e.g., minionint, warnockint, etc...). For example: if
I install WarnockPro package first then the integral sign is taken
from say WarnockPro-It-integral. But if after this I install the
MinionPro package then both MinionPro and WarnockPro packages will
share the same integral sign, namely, MinionPro-It-integral, and so on
and so forth. Is there anything I am missing or this annoyance is
related to MnSymbol package or maybe because of a generic name used in
one of MinionPro sources? Many thanks,

Bernhard.

ps.: Do I need the --expanded option in order to the microtype package works?

This is due to leftover .mtx files in the fontinst directory.

only for the microtype package if the options  
"expansion=true,DVIoutput=true" are used.

Thanks one more time Michael! I also forgot to change the name
"MnSymbolFI" to something else like "WnSymbolFI".

Message-ID: <2257ea30705071136v4dc1873cuff495a524b4f6c93@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

While loading the MinionPro package with the medfamily (or fullfamily)
option in a 10pt article (or report) class all subsubscripts are in
semibold, e.g., in the following expression

$K_{n_An_B}$

A and B are printed as semibolIt. Note that for subsubscripts larger
than 5pt, i.e., for class with options 11pt or 12pt, A and B will not
be printed as semibold but simply as It(alic). Is this an intended
feature of the package?

Regards,

Bernhard.

Sorry for this premature post, I think this is a feature contained in
the MinionPro-FontDef.sty package:

\Mn at AddToConfig{fontset/weight}{fullfamily/m}{
        <-6>    otf* [weight=Semibold]
       <6-8.5>  otf* [weight=Medium]
     <8.5->     otf* [weight=Regular]
}

Thanks,

Bernhard.

I cannot find a new testcase in miktex's bug tracker. Can you please  
keep us updated on this issue?

Message-ID: <000601c7943e$75178f70$fa1d700a@wutm>

I am using the most recent version of MinionPro, and I find that 
the position of superscript s in $L^s$ seems to be too low.
On the other hand, \[ L^s \] is OK.

This is of course only personal opinion, but I wonder if there is any
way to adjust the superscript position.

Thanks!

Hello,

I've put the final version of MinionPro 2.1 on BerliOS. It should also
appear on CTAN soon.

A note for users of 2.1rc3: The archives metrics-full.zip and
metrics-opticals.zip have not changed. There is no need to download them
again.

I'll update promptly. I have a couple of questions on MnSymbol 1.4  
(I'm still using 1.3):

1) As I intend to use the outlines version, I don't have to enable  
the map as MixedMap, right?

2) I see open type fonts (otf), but no indications of how to use  
them. I ask this above all because I was surprised to discover that  
even MnSymbol 1.3 can be used with XeTeX with the following combination:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{MnSymbol}
\let\mathdollar\undefined
%\usepackage{lucbmath}    %% <-- I'll tell about this below
\usepackage[cm-default]{fontspec}
\usepackage{xltxtra}

\defaultfontfeatures{Scale=MatchLowercase,Mapping=tex-text}
\setmainfont[Numbers=Lowercase]{Warnock Pro} %% I don't mean these  
three match with
\setsansfont{Lucida Sans}                    %% MnSymbol. Just an  
example. XeTeX
\setmonofont{Lucida Sans Typewriter}         %% takes them from the  
system (not TeX)
                                              %% installed fonts.  
Change them as you like.
\begin{document}

\begin{center}
   Roman, {\itshape italics} and {\scshape small caps\dots}\\
   {\sffamily\bfseries Bold sans serif and \itshape bold italic sans  
serif\dots}
\end{center}

\[
   \mathcal F(s) = \int^\infty_0 f(t) \exp(-st)\,\mathrm{d}t
\]

\end{document}

The XeTeX driver *has* to be xdvipdfmx (default in Linux and  
Windows), not xdv2pdf (default in Mac OS X).

Now ---in the formula above, examining character by character with  
Acrobat, \mathcal F is taken from MnSymbol, (s) = from Computer  
Modern, \int^\infty from MnSymbol, _0 f(t) from CM, \exp from  
Warnock, (-st) from CM, \mathrm{d} from Warnock, and t from CM.

Using instead lucbmath (from TUG distro), everything in the formula  
is taken from LucidaNewMath, except _0, \exp and \mathrm{d}, which  
are taken from Warnock.

So I'm thinking with MnSymbol otf maybe could be a better integration  
with XeTeX (Lucida is *not* an otf though ---I don't know why it  
works better).


Thank you for your nice work.


Best,

Axel

Hi, Michael!

Sorry my delayed post. The unique certainty I have by now is that the
"--pack" option triggers the Yap's bug. Even creating a new glyph list
with the generate-glyph-list.sh script and then using the "--pack"
option with the just generated list can (unfortunately) trigger the
annoying bug. The only safe way for MiKTeX (and Yap!) users is not to
use the "--pack" option.

Regards and congrats for the new 2.1 release,

Bernhard.

MixedMap is correct.

The otf are provided in order to ease usage/installation for non-TeX  
application. For xetex using the xdvipdfmx route you can use the tfm/ 
pfb combination. The xdv2pdf route doesn't currently work with  
neither tfm/pfb nor otf: tfm are not supported by this driver and  
xetex's unicode math package isn't complete yet. But even if it were  
complete, I don't know how it'd get to know the math fontdimens,  
charlists and the 'extensible' information.

Well, I guess Christian Schenk will get several test cases soon, so  
that the Yap bug will then be fixed. The good point is, the bug is  
not only triggered by our font package but also mtpro2.

OK. Then MixedMap it is. Thank you.

I haven't thought of that. Thank you ---that's nice.

What amaze me is how well XeTeX uses LucidaNewMath, and with  
xdvipdfmx as well as xdv2pdf! I think in the end XeTeX will be able  
to use MnSymbol without resorting to get some symbols from CM, and  
maybe the otf fonts is the way to go.

Slight correction: It is virtual fonts that are not supported by xdv2pdf.

LucidaNewMath does not use virtual fonts. Not to surprising given that it
is rooted in Y&Y.

Even with T1 fontenc? I thought they didn't use virtual fonts only  
with LY1 fontenc ---or is this the case only with non-math Lucida fonts?

I thought we were talking about the math fonts. Whether the T1 encoded
fonts use vf I cannot test right now, since I don't have the fonts here.
Are there any .vf files in the LucidaNewMath distribution? However, with
xetex one normally does not use fontenc.sty anyway.

Hi!

If I got it right now we need tabfigures.sty package in order to
compile the MinionPro documentation, so it is necessary to add the
command "latex tabfigures.ins" to the last line of the "makeall"
script:

(cd tex; latex MinionPro.ins; latex otfontdef.ins; latex fontaxes.ins;
latex tabfigures.ins)

Another haze point, at least to me, is where to use the files:
replace-*.sed and substitutions.list? They seem to be used nowhere in
the compilation process. Maybe they are needed in the generation of
encoding files? Thanks a lot,

Bernhard.

These are files that I used for generating glyph-list*, they are  
currently not needed when generating your own set of metrics. In case  
future versions of MinionPro have different glyphnames these files  
remain in the CVS for convenience.

substitutions.list contains a table of glyphnames that differ between  
font versions, first row: v2000, second row: v1001, third row v1000.

 From this table the replace*.sed files were generated through
   cat substitutions.list | awk '$1!=$3 {print $1" "$3}' | sed -e  
's#^#s/\\\/#' -e 's# #\\\([ ]\\\|$\\\)/\\\/#' -e 's#$# /g#' >  
replace.v1000.sed
   cat substitutions.list | awk '$1!=$2 {print $1" "$2}' | sed -e  
's#^#s/\\\/#' -e 's# #\\\([ ]\\\|$\\\)/\\\/#' -e 's#$# /g#' >  
replace.v1001.sed

The replace*sed files can then be used to convert v2000 enc files  
into that of another font version. The advantage of this approach is  
that now the same set of metrics can be used with all font versions,  
just the enc need to be replaced -- and it works with both packed raw  
encodings and autogenerated encodings. The latter isn't possible if  
otftotfm is run on different encodings, because for example  
automatically allocated encoding slots for f_t and T_h vary between  
font versions (due to different ordering of the lookups in the otf, I  
suppose).

The question that might remain: Where does substitution.list come  
from? This was some perl processing of Andreas, he compared the sets  
of autogenerated .enc files (one set for each font version).

Yes, you're right. I was getting off the subject.

For text, T1 use them; LY1 doesn't.

Bruno Voisin, in the XeTeX mailing list, thinks LucidaNewMath doesn't  
use vf fonts. No doubt you both are right: from readme.lucida, by  
Walter Schmidt:

***
How this collection was created
-------------------------------
The font metrics, virtual fonts and .fd files for the T1 and TS1  
encodings were created using fontinst 1.928. [...]

The font metric files for the LY1 encoded text fonts, as
well as the metrics for the math fonts, are those that were
formerly distributed by Y&Y.

***


> However, with xetex one normally does not use fontenc.sty anyway.

Right. Now, back to the original subject, if Lucida (a distribution  
not prepared with XeTeX in mind) works so well with XeTeX, I'm hoping  
we could use MnSymbol as well in the near future.

Thank you.

fontspec.sty has special handlers for euler/lucida. With

MnSymbol is used, but latin and Greek letters are set in CM (the math  
glyphs that usually are contained in the OML encoding in normal TeX).  
Will's unicode-math seems to be tightly bound to Cambria right now, I  
couldn't get it to work with Minion. Better if this topic moves to  
the XeTeX mailing list, I suppose.

Subject: [Minionpro-devel] Problem with semibold figures
Message-ID: <464B71CD.8000706@web.de>

Hello,

when I compile a document with MinionPro package and the [medfamily] 
option, the following problem occurs: With osf, tabular figures and with 
lining, proportional figures, LaTeX produces only crossed boxes instead 
of the correct glyphs with the semibold font. Strangely, the 
combinations (osf, proportional) and (lining, tabular) work, so both the 
osf and the lining glyphs can be displayed, in principle.

I have the new release v2.1 of MinionPro installed under MikTeX. The 
MinionPro fonts come from Adobe Illustrator CS2, where the normal, bold 
and semibold weights are supplied (font version 2.000 if I remember 
correctly).

Can someone reproduce this bug? Or even better, does anyone know a 
solution? I attach a minimal example file below.

Apart from this little bug (which can certainly be fixed) I would like 
to thank the authors of the MinionPro package. You did a great job, 
since it's one of the most usable LaTeX font packages and one of the 
very few which one can seriously typeset mathematics with.

Regards,

Johann

IIRC the fonts supplied with CS2 are a mixture of v2000 and v1001. If  
this applies then http://tinyurl.com/38yuc6 may help.

Sorry. Uninstalling MinionPro and reinstalling version 2.1 and running
your minimal example again in fact triggers the Yap! bug.

It could be nice if every MiKTeX and MinionPro user could confirm this
issue with the minimal example file provided.

Hello,

> triggers the Yap bug "invalid vector<T> subscript" if used with  
> MinionPro v2.1?

yesterday I installed MiKTeX 2.6 in a virtual machine and did some
experiments trying to minimize Michael's example. This is as far as I
could get: A minimal TeX file referencing a single letter of a
non-virtual font (bug.tex) plus the necessary font metrics (bug.pl).

Could anybody please confirm that the following procedure triggers the
above-mentioned bug?

  1.  pltotf bug.pl bug.tfm
  2.  tex bug
  3.  yap bug
      (and switch to the 'dvips' render method if not already done)

(No actual font files or map-file entries are necessary; the bug seems
to occur at this very early stage of processing the DVI and TFM.)

bug.pl actually is a stripped-down version of
MinionPro-Regular-Base-aa.pl; further reduction of its size proved very
difficult: When some character is removed (or even when the width of
some character is changed (?!)), the message "invalid vector<T>
subscript" does not show anymore. (I did not check each and every
combination, only 3 or 4 changes.)

Regards,

Andreas

executing "make_all"? Maybe interrupting, changing and resume?

I want to replace some Characters in mathmode.

Regards,

Ronny

The simplest way would be to run the scripts and afterwards create the
vpl with vftovp. Alternatively, you could modify our scripts such that
otftotfm creates vpl files.

Subject: [Minionpro-devel] minion pro with gwTeX
Message-ID: <3E826830-F336-4F01-B417-EC846B9A1C60@philosophy.rutgers.edu>

Hi all,

Sorry if this question is too basic for this list.  Chistoph Shiller  
said that someone here might be able to help.

I'm using the gwTeX distribution for Mac OS X, and am having trouble  
getting MinionPro to work.  (I got it to work on one of my machines a  
few months ago, and just tried and failed to install it on another,  
but can't figure out what the relevant difference is.  Though I just  
noticed that the version of MinionPro on the working machine is 2.0  
and that the version on the unworking one is 2.1)  I have all the  
MinionPro files in the right place in my local texmf tree, ~/Library/ 
texmf.  As near as I can tell (though I'm no expert), the information  
for the MinionPro font isn't making its way into  	

	/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map

(which, I gather, is created by updmap.)  But I have done:

	sudo updmap --enable Map MinionPro.map

At any rate, that's where I'm stuck.  I'm guessing the problem has  
something to do with the multiple texmf trees of gwTeX, and map  
information going in the wrong place?  At any rate, any help would be  
most appreciated!  (In case this is not enough information, I'm  
pasting in below the full output from LaTeX console, from a failed  
attempt to typset using MinionPro.sty, as well as some of the .log  
file from that same attempt.)

Thanks, and sorry again to bother.

updmap will create a pdftex.map file for the user --- root in this case,
I guess. (`sudo locate pdftex.map` should tell you something)

Remove all unnecessary map files and try again with updmap-sys.

Hi; thanks for replying.  I'd already tried using updmap-sys.   I  
tried it again; still no luck.  I didn't remove any unnecessary map  
fails since I don't know enough about TeX's workings to know which  
files are unnecessary.  Any other suggestions (or suggestions about  
which map files to remove?)

By the way, `sudo locate pdftex.map` returned this (on both machines,  
including the one where everything is working fine):

	/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map

What do `grep MinionPro $(locate updmap.cfg)` and `locate updmap.cfg`
report? (this assumes bash --- if it doesn't work just substitute $(..)
with the filenames returned by the latter command)

Perhaps 'sudo updmap' doesn't see files in ~/Library ? Did you try
moving those file into /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local ?

BTW, you ran texhash on the relevant directories (~/Library, I guess),
didn't you?

`grep MinionPro $(locate updmap.cfg)` reports:

	/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/web2c/updmap.cfg:Map MinionPro.map

`locate updmap.cfg` reports:

/usr/local/teTeX/man/man5/updmap.cfg.5

/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/web2c/updmap.cfg

I just tried moving the files to /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local  
-- still doesn't work.  (The files are in ~/Library/texmf in the  
computer on which MinionPro is working, by the way.)


> BTW, you ran texhash on the relevant directories (~/Library, I guess),

In the past I have only run texhash using `sudo texhash`.  I hadn't  
run texhash *on*  ~/Library (I thought you didn't have to.)  Just now  
I ran `texhash ~/Library` (and also `texhash ~/Library/texmf`, in  
case that's what you meant).  Still doesn't work.

By the way, thanks for taking so much time with this.

p.s. one other thing, which may or may not be relevant: the .tfm  
files on the computer where MinionPro.sty works are different from  
the ones where it isn't working.  The nonworking one has, e.g.,    
MinionPro-Regular-Base-aa.tfm; whereas the working maching has, e.g.,

Hi Achim,

thanks for replying.   I've pasted the output below.  Meanwhile, just  
a couple more things that I've learned, which may or may not be  
relevant.  First, when I emailed earlier, I hadn't realized that the / 
usr/local/teTeX hierarchy is irrelevant to my distribution of gwTeX  
(which is the most recent one, based on TeXLive 2007.)  I think it's  
left over on the machine from an earlier TeX installation.  Second:   
I actually have two machines.  On one, I got MinionPro to work, on  
the other I've failed.  And I've noticed a few differences between  
these machines.  First, when I run updmap (see the output below), on  
each machine it says that the config file it's using is /usr/local/ 
gwTeX/texmf.local/web2c/updmap.cfg.   But when I look inside this  
file, it has Map MinionPro.map on the machine in which things are NOT  
working.  On the machine where the font IS working, /usr/local/gwTeX/ 
texmf.local/web2c/updmap.cfg does NOT contain this command.   Second,  
I noticed that the .tfm files on the computer where everything is  
working are different from the files on the computer where it isn't  
working.  The nonworking computer has, e.g., MinionPro-Regular-Base- 
aa.tfm; whereas the working computer has, e.g., MinionPro-Regular-lf- 
l1-lgi--base.tfm.  I also note that the .tfm files on the working  
computer were created in 2005, whereas the .tfm files on the  
nonworking computer were created by me recently.  (I installed  
MinionPro on the working computer a few months ago; could this have  
something to do with the fact that the package was recently updated?)

Output follows:
