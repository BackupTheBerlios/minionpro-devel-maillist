Subject: [Minionpro-devel] v-nu confusion in Minion Pro

Hello Achim,

I apologize in advance if you are not an appropriate person to write  
with this request. I use Minion Pro (thank you!) for nearly all my  
LaTeX documents, but have run into the problem that the letters 'v'  
and '\nu' are virtually indistinguishable in math mode. As I am a  
physicist, I use both these symbols quite frequently, making it  
confusing for my students. On the other hand, I never use \upsilon,  
which looks enough like an italic 'v' to make a solution possible:  
substitute \upsilon for 'v' when in math mode. Unfortunately, I don't  
know how to manage this, as I don't really understand the font system  
in TeX. Is it possible (and easy) to remap just that one character as  
I describe? If so, I would be most grateful for directions. Vielen dank.

The easiest solution is to use a TeX-macro, but it requires extra
typing:

\newcommand\v{\upsilon}

$\v \neq \nu$

Otherwise, you can also use fontinst to create your own virtual font
with an upsilon instead of the v. But this is a bit more involved.

How about  using



\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{MinionPro}
\DeclareMathSymbol{v}{\mathalpha}{letters}{"1D}

\begin{document}

$ u v w \boldsymbol{u} \boldsymbol{v} $

\end{document}




That gives the intended result for me. However, \mathbf{v} yields a  
bold fl ligature...

Cheers,
