Thank you for your hint.

Ok, following TeXbook, the kerning with the skewchar definies the placement of 
the accents. In the fontinst/mn-oml-*.etx I found
\nextslot{255}
\setslot{skew}
\endsetslot
Looking in enc/mn-t1.enc, /germandbls is the last glyph. So the kerning pairs 
X.swash and germandbls define the placements of glyphs. And there are already 
kerning pairs like this in kerning/*It*.kern. Fine. (Although they are for 
Germandbls so upper case, I guess it's ok.) But running maketfm, I get  
warnings like this:

otftotfm: ./enc/mn-It-t1.enckern:169: warning: 'A.swash' has no encoding, 
ignoring '{180}'

running eg

otftotfm --tfm-directory=tfm --vf-directory=vf --encoding-directory=dvips --
no-type1 --no-updmap --no-dotlessj --warn-missing -fkern   -fliga -flnum -
fpnum --include-alternates '*.swash' -faalt -e 'enc/mn-It-t1.enckern' 
'otf/MinionPro-It.otf' 'MinionPro-It-lf-swash-t1'

It seems that the kerning pair and all other swash ones are ignored, because 
they are not included in the encoding. So I modified the maketfm script to use 
different enckern files for the swash letters where each X.swash kerning pair 
is replaced by a X pair (as far as I can see, otftotfm just treats X.swash as 
X) and all other uppercase X pairs are removed. And this works! Now, the 
accents look nice!

Still, there still a lot of other warnings of this kind, different ones for 
different encodings so there might at least one which uses the pairs...

What do you think?
Sebastian

PS:  I use the latest version of lcdf-typetools, that still works with the 
scripts (2.69). If you had a hint how to get a list of all the changed glyph 
names, I could have a look at this. I had a look at the sources of lcdf and I 
was not able to retrieve that information.
