Subject: [Minionpro-devel] onlytext required?
Message-ID: <20070709125722.GB24507@krille.blacktrash.org>

Hello,

I recently updated from CVS, and now some documents seem to
require the "onlytext" option to compile without errors.
Otherwise I get:

! Font OML/MinionPro-TOsF/m/it/12=MinionPro-Mixed-oml at 12.0pt not loadable:
Metric (TFM) file not found.

Is this due to a change, or did something go wrong with my
install?

c
