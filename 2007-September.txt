I would like to ask whether developers of MinionPro package
consider support for ArnoPro font? ArnoPro font may become in near future
so popular like minion and it has a lot of advantages, for instance
richer suit of glyphs (especially in the case of superscript).

Thanks for any answers

It would be fantastic because ArnoPro is a really nice looking
typeface with full of (greek, math, and more) symbols! I'm not a
MinionPro developer, but the first problem I see in the development of
a ArnoPro package based on MinionPro is the all new naming scheme
(e.g., the prefix of ligatures) used by Adobe, which differs
substantially from MinionPro. I've already tried to adapt MinionPro to
ArnoPro myself, but, in my opinion, there is no easy way (automated)
to do this. Maybe the best thing to do is start from the beginning
and, in this case, I'm here at your service.

All the best,

Bernhard Enders.

The adaptation of our setup to ArnoPro should be fairly easy. The  
different glyph naming scheme for certain opentype features doesn't  
matter much as those are mostly automatically selected via otftotfm.  
Exceptions where mn-*.enc may have to be altered, or better, where  
unicoding-statements would have to be added to a .cfg file are
  - encoding slots where explicitly alternates are selected, e.g.,  
"glpyh.xxx"
  - encoding slots pointing to the 'private use area', i.e., unie000- 
unif8ff

I've typeset a couple of lines of ArnoPro with xetex, Latin glyphs  
resemble those of Minion with a slight attitude, the Greek ones are a  
bit more calligraphic/less cool, so they'll probably appeal better to  
those typesetting ancient greek texts. Stroke thicknesses and style  
should be compatible with MnSymbol, that makes life easy.

Why do you fancy the extra symbols, in particular superscript  
letters? Such things are pretty much covered by optical shapes.

Looking forward to seeing some sample math documents typeset with  
Arno ;-)
Michael

PS: I just notice that Arno comes with five instead of four optical  
sizes. No idea how difficult it would be to extend fontaxes.sty/ 
otfontdef.sty.

    This seems like another opportunity to shamelessly plug "otftofd" 
(http://free-the-mallocs.com/otftofd).  It is a tool I have written that 
specially automates the task of generating the infrastructure for a 
collection of OpenType fonts, especially those with several optical 
variants.  Basic usage is to just run "otftofd *.otf" in the directory 
with your font files and it will reconstruct all the appropriate 
infrastructure for you.  Because it handles the detail of determining 
the optical sizes available from the files themselves, it does not 
matter how many optical variants exist. 

    Now the infrastructure it generates is not nearly as polished 
(optimized font encodings, kerning, etc.) as the Minionpro package, 
because it is entirely automated (though you can tell it to use custom 
encodings), but it is a good starting point if you would like to try out 
a new typeface (and cannot use XeTeX for whatever reasons).

The same I got with autoinst.

This is why I ask about possible 'ArnoPro package'.

    This seems kind of strange.  The version of cork.enc (T1) that comes 
with my LaTeX installation has both the f_i and f_l ligatures 
specified.  I wonder what it is trying to displace them with.  What does 
running

    grep /fl `kpsewhich cork.enc`

tell you?

    Looking closely at the documentation for otftotfm seems to indicate 
that the above message might be resulting simply from the small-caps 
version of ArnoPro, where these ligatures probably do not exist.

    I suppose my point was that unless there is a plan for such a 
package, that this is probably the best automation you can expect as a 
starting point (though I'm definitely open to addressing deficiencies).  
I hadn't really heard about autoinst before, however.  It seems to do a 
few more things for you, but overall the design appears to be remarkable 
similar to my own.  Of course, no one should trust programs written in 
Perl :-) 

    As an alternative using XeTeX may be your next best choice, but I 
haven't really had the time to investigate the ins and outs there.

Personally, I do have no plans to work on this. I don't own the font.

Hello,

I would like to ask if it's possible to make all the letters in
mathmode upright.
because by issuing frenchmath option, only greek letter changes but
latin letter stay the same.

Thanks

I don't know your field of expertise, but speaking as a mathematician
--- since it's math fonts we're talking about --- that would look
*weird*

Are you sure you don't want to use \operatorname or \DeclareMathOperator
as of the amsmath package?

Cheers,
 Ottavio G. Rizzo

Thanks for your reply. Well..., I know math letters should appear
italic in literature now , I just wonder if the frenchmath should like
the style in Henri Cartan's Elementary theory of analytic function or
in those books of Bourbaki: the uppercase letters and greeks appear
upright  and only lowercase appears italic.
