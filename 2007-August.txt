I like the MinionPro package for text, but (on my system at least)
equations can look very strange.  For example, the code below produces
the PDF file at: http://willmore.eu/minion.pdf

To my eye, the braces are far too heavy, make the appearance of
equations very uneven.  This happens both on screen and in printed
copies of the document.

I wonder:

* Do the braces look excessively heavy to other people or is my sense
of aesthetics out of whack?
* Do the braces appear this heavy on other systems or have I messed up
the installation of the font somehow?

Typesetting your example, I get a very similar output, but not  
exactly, because you're using the bitmapped MnSymbol, while I'm using  
the new postscript (*.pfb) fonts, which look better. Take a look at  
your \sqrt at a 1000 magnification and you'll see it's very obvious.


Best,

Axel

I intentionally made the delimiters thicker than the Computer Modern
ones. But I'm not sure I didn't overdo it a bit. In particular I'm not
that satisfied with the round parentheses.

Subject: [Minionpro-devel] Problem with quotedblright and loosequotes
Message-ID: <d9992134cdf19a410ee697f6f472bfab.qmail@home.pl>

I've observed that loosequote option to Minion.sty is quite useful 
according to fact
that single quoteright are commonly used for instance in
French or English and this option is some kind of a workaround
obscure kerning settings of quotes in MinionPro.
However turning this option on affects also quotedblright -- distance
between two quoterights of whose quotedblright is composed
is significantly increased. Example of such situation
you can see in example http://www.bezda.com/loosequotes.pdf .

Thanks for any answer.

Message-ID: <212fd83522340bb8a8dc340962d219f9.qmail@home.pl>

My question is as follows: how can I use superiors letters.
They are "? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?" and looks nice as ordinals.
Other problem is how to turn on two alternatives K,R,k,r?

Thanks for any answer.

Yes, this is intended for consistency reasons. If you use single quotes
and double quotes with the loosequotes option the spacing should be the
same.

You package only support superior figures.

One way to use these glyphs would be to use our scripts to compile the
metrics yourselves. You can add an encoding file of your own containing
these glyphs.

For such things I'd use XeTeX for the text, for math our setup. XeTeX  
is now also available for Windows in Miktex 2.7beta.
