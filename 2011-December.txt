Hello,

I am interested in using MnSymbol with ConTeXt and LuaTeX. After a
little research I am trying to figure out whether I can do anything
myself to make MnSymbol available in ConTeXt. So, I have a couple of
questions:

1. One of the ConTeXt font support gurus advised me to work on a
mapping vector to UTF8 (example is from Lucida Math support):

> You need to define a mapping vector to map from 8bit font to UTF-8.

> ? ?[0x1D6E4] = 0x00, -- Gamma
> ? ?[0x1D6E5] = 0x01, -- Delta

Has anyone already defined such a mapping?


2, Regarding the Opentype fonts on CTAN, are there any plans to add
MATH table support? Without MATH tables, how are the OTF fonts used?

Thanks,
PPN

Not to my knowledge. Note that many symbols in the MnSymbol font are not
covered by Unicode.

These fonts are mainly intended to be used with TeX, where the
information in the TeX metric files is sufficient.
I have no idea what it would take to make the fonts usable in other
programs.
