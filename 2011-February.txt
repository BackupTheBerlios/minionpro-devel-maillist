Subject: [Minionpro-devel] Re-Mapping characters for font version 2.03
Message-ID: <4D48E72A.2904.81C704C@xavier.brusset.essca.fr>

Good morning,
I have installed MinionPro package.
Everything works except for some extra mathematical symbols which do not appear in pdf 
documents.

Apparently this is because the mapping of the font in version 2.03 is different from the 
previous versions.
I have tried changing the mapping in MinionPro.sty (lines 500 to 511) but I do not know how 
to code the position of the characters.
In particular, I am interested in the dotlessj (uni 0237) and openg (uni0434).
When I run t1testpage on the MinionPro-it.pfb I see both characters.

Any help in finding how to change the definition of at least \jmath and \openg would be 
greatly appreciated!
Thanks.

Regards.
