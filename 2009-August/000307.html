<PRE>&gt;<i> If someone sends me an enc-2.030.zip I can include it in the release.
</I>
Thank you Achim.  Unfortunately I'm having a difficult time with this
package.  I'm running MikTeX 2.7 and 2.8 under Windows Vista with
Cygwin.

Here's what I'm trying to do.  I had version 2.015 of the MinionPro
base fonts (Reg, Bold, It, BoldIt).  These work flawlessly, but I'd
like to use optical fonts as well, so I got the full set of 2.030 from
Adobe Font Folio 11.

Following the instructions in &quot;README&quot; I added the extra metrics,
generated the pfb, added them to my texmf, refreshed the filename
database, and ran updmap.

My document looks great with the optical fonts, however, several
characters are missing, replaced by a boxed X.  These missing
characters include \epsilon, \ell and \openg.  This is essentially the
same problem reported by shuangwu on BerliOS:
  <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/support/?func=detailsupport&amp;support_id=102944&amp;group_id=2184">http://developer.berlios.de/support/?func=detailsupport&amp;support_id=102944&amp;group_id=2184</A>

I don't know why this is happening, but based solely on the fact that
there are enc-vX.XXX.zip files, my guess is that the encoding changed.
 Is this a reasonable assumption?

I compared the OTFs in character map, and there's a character that
looks just like \upell at U+2113hex.  (See the attached images.)  So
it looks like the unicode character remains unchanged.  The only place
I see \ell in the entire package is MinionPro.sty:
  \DeclareMathSymbol{\ell} {\mathord}{letters}{'140}
  \DeclareMathSymbol{\upell} {\mathord}{letters}{'340}
I certainly don't understand what's going wrong.  The .enc files don't
look to me like they convey the information necessary to fix this
problem.  Do I also need to replace the metrics or something?

I tried to use Cygwin to run the scripts to compile things myself.
I'm trying to follow the procedure you gave to Johannes on 17 Jul
2008:

  $ ./scripts/makeall --nodotlessj
  $ ./scripts/generate-glyph-list.sh &gt;./scripts/glyph-list-2.030
  $ ./scripts/makeall --verbose --nodotlessj --pack=./scripts/glyph-list-2.030
(previously there was a typo in the last line: &quot;glyph-list.2.030&quot;)

This was a huge pain for several reasons.  Makeall takes about an hour
to run.  Unfortunately MiKTeX doesn't use kpathsea, so I get all these
kpathsea errors about &quot;texmf.cnf not found.&quot;  But I think all the
necessary files are being found, and that this is ignorable.  The
scripts seem to have a few minor errors:

scripts/maketfm: line 23: ((: 2 &lt; 2 || (2 == 2 &amp;&amp; 79
 &lt; 62) : syntax error: invalid arithmetic operator (error token is &quot;
 &lt; 62) &quot;)
scripts/beautify-enc.sh: line 3: ed: command not found

And then there are some more serious errors, I suspect because
fontinst might play weirdly with MiKTeX:

? [prompt]


I ignored the errors and hoped for the best.  (Do these steps just
copy the files to texmf, or do they do something vital?)  I then copy
over the .enc, and nothing seems to change...
[Digression: Okay, this is very strange: earlier I could edit
base-MinionPro-ax.enc, swap the order of two characters, and then
LaTeX would render accordingly.  Now my changes do nothing.  (I know
it's reading the file since it complains about it.)]
...so then I copy over the .tfm and .vf, but the result is to scramble
the characters.

Ugh, I spent too much time on this, thinking I almost had it.  It
would probably help if I had a better idea of what I'm doing.  Any
help would be greatly appreciated!
