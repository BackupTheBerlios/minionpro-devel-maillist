<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I can understand the choice of 5-pointed asterisk for marking

That's just because most mathematical texts are set in a baroque or
romantic typeface like Times or Modern, which have asterisks with six
tear-drop shaped arms.

&gt;<i> He says that mathematical asterisk should always be six-pointed with
</I>&gt;<i> one vertical stroke and two cross strokes. His explanation for this is
</I>&gt;<i> because mathematicians want the asterisk to look like the ones they
</I>&gt;<i> draw by hand, and five-point asterisks are difficult by hand.
</I>
I think the reason is rather the one you stated above: most people are
more used to six-pointed asterisks.

I do not accept this argument. In the same way you could argue that all
mathematical texts should be set in Computer Modern: that's what most
mathematicians are used to.

It would be something different if the shape were that unfamiliar to
readers that they could hardly read the symbol. But that's not the case
here: most people would instantly agree that it's an asterisk, although
one that looks a bit funny.

&gt;<i> &gt; That leads to inconsistency.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, one way is inconsistent between the text and the mathematics,
</I>&gt;<i> but the other way is (as far as I can tell) inconsistent with general
</I>&gt;<i> mathematical typography.
</I>
It's not inconsistent, just different.
