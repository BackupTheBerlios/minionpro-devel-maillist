I understand that you would prefer something more concrete than my gut
feeling, but this is all I have :-)

I suppose the reason is that the five-pointed version seems very
unfamiliar. I don't recall ever seeing a five-pointed mathematical
asterisk in any books or papers I have read. I am not any kind of a
typographer, so I don't have any reference books to look up all
different fonts, but I just checked the mathematical books on my shelf
and they all use six-pointed mathematical asterisks. As I said, even
Lucida uses six-points for mathematics when it uses five-points for
text. And I just found googled for some other mathematical fonts and I
found Bitstream Charter uses 5-points for text but Micropress CH Math
font (which is a mathematical extension of Bitstream Charter) also
uses six points:
<A HREF="http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts/chmath/chf2.htm">http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts/chmath/chf2.htm</A>
The same thing is true with Micropress HV Math:
<A HREF="http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts/hvmath/hvmain.htm">http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts/hvmath/hvmain.htm</A>
And also Micropress PA Math:
<A HREF="http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts/pamath/pamain.htm">http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts/pamath/pamain.htm</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> I see that at least one typographer agrees with me on this point:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb27-0/kuster.pdf">http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb27-0/kuster.pdf</A> . &quot;...most fonts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already contain an asterisk * (U+002A), but normally the latter is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suitable for math, which uses a larger version, six-pointed...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way I read that passage, the reason for the unsuitability of the
</I>&gt;<i> supplied asterisk is that it is not centred. I don't think the number of
</I>&gt;<i> points is that important.
</I>
Well, in I found a talk by him which you can listen to here:
<A HREF="http://river-valley.tv/minion-math-a-new-math-font-family/">http://river-valley.tv/minion-math-a-new-math-font-family/</A>
(it seems he is designing some kind of a competitor to MnSymbol) he is
quite specific (around the 21:30 mark). He says that mathematical
asterisk should always be six-pointed with one vertical stroke and two
cross strokes. His explanation for this is because mathematicians want
the asterisk to look like the ones they draw by hand, and five-point
asterisks are difficult by hand. (I find this a fairly weak argument,
I admit, because many mathematical symbols are not so easy to draw by
hand, for example fractur letters).

&gt;&gt;<i> Please consider to use the same model as is done with Lucida: keep the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original Slimbach text asterisk but for the mathematical asterisks use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a six-pointed form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That leads to inconsistency.
</I>
Well, one way is inconsistent between the text and the mathematics,
but the other way is (as far as I can tell) inconsistent with general
mathematical typography.

At least four fonts that I could find in a few minutes of searching
the web (lucida, charter/ch math, hv math, pa math) preferred the
former kind of inconsistency, and none that I could find preferred the
latter.
