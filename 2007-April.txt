Sorry, this cannot be corrected on the metrics level.

I do not know whether this is related to my recent upgrade to the  
current TeXLive (and therefore, to a current pdflatex and microtype),  
or whether this is caused by the new RC 1.3 of MinionPro, but  
suddenly I see all kinds of overlapping right margin, like this:

Please provide minimal examples in the future.

With TL2007 on a Mac using pdflatex and

\documentclass[a5paper,pagesize,10pt]{scrbook}
\usepackage{MinionPro}
\usepackage[expansion=false]{microtype}
\begin{document}\parindent=0pt
as  dependency dependency dependency dependency
dependency dependency dependency dependency
as dependency dependency dependency dependency
as dependency dependency dependency dependency
ndency dependency dependency dependency \emph{weakly}

I don't get this problem. Perhaps in your log you simply get an  
overfull hbox?

Sorry, I did not make myself clear.

I was merely using the screenshot to demonstrate that I now in fact  
DO get overfull hboxes, where earlier on I did not get them. I do not  
really see a reason for why they should be there, however; the word  
dependen-cy can be hyphenated by splitting off the last two letters,  
which (especially if you are using microtype) should not be something  
that generates overfull hboxes. Actually, I cannot imagine of ever  
getting overfull hboxes since I switched to using microtype.

That's what has changed, and I just wanted to know whether anyone on  
the list is experiencing the same problems.

     Best,
     Marco

I just compiled a book that used to have 749 pages, now it has 753.  
I'll have a look at this issue, also cross-checking with a miktex setup.

Hello Bernhard,

I haven't had a look at setups for other fonts for quite a while...  
Essentially the scripts on Berlios are easily portable to other  
fonts, it's mostly substituting "MinionPro" for xxx, same applies to  
MinionPro.dtx/ins. I assume to get this part of the port done will  
only take some 20 minutes (you'll also find some files for  
GaramondPremierPro/MyriadPro in CVS, including special kerning pairs).

Concerning the math setup, with the settings of MinionPro you're  
already quite ok, but to have 100% quality support, you'll have to  
spend some time adapting
  - adjust-oml.mtx to get the side bearings and accent positions 100%  
ok (with MinionPro's settings you'll have a 90% solution)
  - *intop*mtx to get an equivalent of the minionint option working.  
(You can omit this if you're fine with MinionPro's integral in the  
other font's math setup. If not: Select the otf from which the  
integral shall be taken for the text and display version, choose an  
appropriate Extend/Slant value for each, then position the glyphs in  
the aforementioned *intop*mtx)

I did these things for some fonts a while ago, but didn't put that  
all in the CVS, and what I didn't put there got lost in the  
meantime ;-/ (Essentially nobody else was interested, I wasn't happy  
with Warnock/GaramondPremier/Myriad for math typesetting and so  
didn't push further.) The result of what I did those days can be  
found on
   http://www.hft.ei.tum.de/mz/testmath_fourier_pnc.pdf
   http://www.hft.ei.tum.de/mz/testmath_gara.pdf
   http://www.hft.ei.tum.de/mz/testmath_gentium.pdf

   http://www.hft.ei.tum.de/mz/testmath_myriad_light.pdf
   http://www.hft.ei.tum.de/mz/testmath_pazo_mnsymbol.pdf

Something else you may want to consider (e.g., for Warnock/Myriad):  
MnSymbol's stroke thickness is a bit too thin for some fonts. This  
can be dealt with but be warned, this may cost time: You can creaty a  
modified version of MnSymbol (call it MySymbol/WaSymbol or whatever)  
with different parameters in MnSymbol-Parameter.mf. Be careful that  
Metafont doesn't throw "strange path" errors.
Getting high-quality (non-autotraced) Type1 fonts for your adapted  
version will be yet more work ;-) If you made it to the point that  
you get an adaptation of MnSymbol to run with Metafont (i.e., as a  
bitmap font) and it looks ok with Myriad/Warnock, then please drop me  
a mail; perhaps I'll be of some help for getting the high-quality  
Type1 managed (just too long to explain now).

Good luck, it's not nearly as scary as it seems at first sight.
Michael

PS: otftotfm 2.61 is buggy (see our mailing list), better wait for an  
update.

Greetings, I read this list, and have a comment: 

Of the commercial typefaces mentioned above (Garamond, Galliard,
Warnock), I want to tell that I regard Warnock to be in a class for
itself for mathematical texts (maybe close to or even equally good as
Minion):

1) Warnock does possess much of the elegance of Minion, at the same time
Warnock is more robust than Minion (moving on the scale a bit in the
direction towards Utopia/Fourier.) Warnock Caption seems to me to be
maybe more readable in very small sizes than is Minion Pro caption, and
Warnock may, I believe, put lesser demand on printer technology quality
than does Minion.
2) Warnock seems to be very complete (Greek and often missed ligatures
like fj and ffj are there.)
3) Warnock has a very readable italic (in contrast to Garamond Pro,
which I find completely unsuitable for mathematics.)
4) Warnock in normal text sizes feels rather neutral (like Minion and
Kepler) and do (for my eyes) not call attention to itself (in contrast
to Galliard and Palatino, which I like for many purposes, but not for
educational texts.)

So, while I feel that Minion Pro for mathematics do fill what would else
be a whole in the set of available math typefaces, I would personally be
happy if among the other fonts mentioned above, Warnock would be chosen
if someone is going to use time for parallel development.

Best wishes to all for future development and thanks a lot for all the
time used and good work done.

Jan Gunnar Moe

Bernhard,

if you consider making math metrics for Warnock, you may consider  
mixing Warnock with the FourierGutenberg fonts instead of MnSymbol.

Best,
Michael

I forgot to mentioned that I still use "2005/09/25 v2.0" of
MinionPro and "2007/01/21 v2.0" of microtype. The problem occurs
only with pdfTeX 1.40.3-2.2 but not with pdfTeX 1.21a-2.2.

Just to make sure: With a completely unchanged setup of MinionPro/ 
MnSymbol you get different results depending on the pdftex compiler?

Yesterday I installed TeXLive 2007 on my office desktop that uses
the same texmf tree ($TEXMFHOME) as on my laptop and home desktop. I
only copied ~/.texmf-config and ~/.texmf-var (from teTeX3) to
~/.texlive2007, added ?!!$TEXMFHOME? to texmf.cnf and called
mktexlsr. That's it.

Now I made a diff of the log files to send to this list and found
that there were no hyphenation patterns loaded for ngerman. The
TeXLive installation seems to be broken:

$ grep german `kpsewhich language.dat`
german          xu-dehypht.tex
ngerman         xu-dehyphn.tex
$ locate xu-dehyph
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/generic/xu-hyphen/xu-dehyphn.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/generic/xu-hyphen/xu-dehypht.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/generic/xu-hyphen/xu-dehyphtex.tex

I'll be back in office next thursday to investigate further.

Happy Easter!

Nice hint! I changed my document to use ukenglish instead of british  
as an option for babel, and get different hyphenations, even though  
(according to the babel documentation) the two options should be  
equivalent.

One has to bear in mind that the new metrics are all generated from  
font version 2.000, so they may differ from the v1.00x ones slightly.
I just tested on a miktex 2.5 system with MnSymbol 1.4 a 750 pages book
  1) a setup with the old MinionPro release (v1001 metrics)
  2) RC 3 (v2000 metrics)
result: one different page break on one page, but I didn't spot a  
single different line break.

Inspecting
   otftotfm -e ../enc/mn-t1.enc -p -fkern -fliga ../../fonts/otf/ 
MinionPro/v2000/MinionPro-Regular.otf stand2000
   otftotfm -e ../enc/mn-t1.enc -p -fkern -fliga ../../fonts/otf/ 
MinionPro/v1001/MinionPro-Regular.otf stand1001
   otftotfm -e ../enc/mn-t1.enc -p -fkern -fliga ../../fonts/otf/ 
MinionPro/v1000/MinionPro-Regular.otf stand1000

and then diffing the vpl there is no difference in CHARWD in 2000 and  
1001, just a few between 2000 and 1000. But CHARHT/CHARDP do vary in  
many cases (but only very slightly).

the previous diff showed the difference if both the metrics and the  
pfb font version are changed, <http://www.hft.ei.tum.de/mz/diff2.png>  
compares what happens if *only* the metrics change.

This might be unrelated, but I'm having the same problem with a book  
with Lucida fonts.

I use Gerben Wierda's teTeX distribution (pdfeTeX 1.30.4-2.2), Gerben  
Wierda's TeXLive distribution (pdfTeX 1.40.3-2.2) and TeXLive-2007  
(pdfTeX 1.40.3-2.2).

(As some may know, thanks to a Gerben Wierda-Jerome Laurens device,  
on MacOS X you can shift from one TeX distribution to another through  
a Preference panel.)

I have *all* my Lucida font files in my personal TeX branch in my  
HOME directory, so all of the above TeX distribution have to use  
exactly the same Lucida metrics, *.pbf, .sty, etc., files.

Now ---a 180 pages book typeset last may typesets exactly the same  
with GW's teTeX distro (updated 2007/01/03) but gives 184 pages with  
either GW's TeXLive or TeXLive-2007. There are simple differences, as  
words hyphenating differently (but both right), or major differences,  
as text flowing differently from one page to the next.

Before posting the issue to appropriate mailing lists (pdftex,  
texhax), I've been trying to isolate the problem using in both  
TeXLive distros the same package versions as in teTeX, but I haven't  
had any luck ---I'm starting to believe the worst: a pdfTeX issue.

Once I'm done trying with every single package the book uses, I'll  
post my findings to the mailing lists above, but seeing you have the  
same problem with MinionPro, I thought it might be worth to let you  
know.


Best,

Axel

Hi Andreas,

Thanks for this bug report, which is fixed in 2.62.  Simple fix: I 
downgraded the "--unicoding command" message from an error to a warning.

2.62 also has a more significant fix.  The t1dotlessj program previously 
generated fonts with bad UniqueID values, the same as the input font. 
This can produce some real problems with older printers.  The new 
version is smarter.  I'd recommend using it.

Eddie

Indeed, there was something wrong with my TL installation.[1] I fixed it
and now everything is ok.

[1] There were .fmt files in $HOME which were used by (pdf)latex but
were not recreated with fmtutil-sys, of course. Invoking fmtutil to
recreate the formats solved the problem.

I would create my own dummy amssymb.sty in the current directory.

Hi!

After updating to MinionPro rc3 Yap (the DVI viewer from MiKTeX
distribution for Windows) now is unable to open any minimal file using
minionpro fonts in the Dvips render method (no problem with the
default pk method). Does anybody know if this is a problem with Yap or
MinionPro rc3? The message error follows:

PowerUser: no

Thanks,

Bernhard.

ps.: the convert procedure was done with the latest version (v2.62) of
lcdf tools.

No. In fact I have just uninstalled MiKTeX 2.5 and all related files,
folders and programs but the problem still remains even with a clean
minionpro install.

Does the dvips->ps2pdf route work correctly? If yes, it is likely to  
be a yap bug.

Yes, it works fine this way (the same is true for pdflatex). I will
post this problem in the MiKTeX users list. Thank you,

Bernhard.

Subject: [Minionpro-devel] Changing MinionPro font size
Message-ID: <2257ea30704171425q27e715eai631b7b6cc502df67@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry my ignorance, but Adobe Minion Pro fonts seem to be smaller (by
design) than Times Roman or Palatino at the same point size, since
there is no option like "scaled" in the MinionPro package, what can
one do to change the "base" font size to, say, 13 pt easily? One
solution would be to redefine every LaTeX font command this way:

\makeatletter\renewcommand\normalsize{\@setfontsize\normalsize{24}{48}}\makeatother

But this way one have also change the default baselineskip for each
font size, probably messing other things. Is there any support in the
MinionPro package for this size changing or are there any known
package to support this kind of requirement?

Thanks in advance,

Bernhard.

ps.: Yap is really buggy with the latest version (rc3) of MinionPro.
The issue can be found in the Yap's Knowledge database.

Subject: [Minionpro-devel] Make \preceq more equal to \leq
Message-ID: <23DA83D7-49D1-4B89-8E40-79FEAF693E6C@mcqm.net>

     Dear list,

some of you may be interested in the following change to MnSymbol. I  
recently wrote a text about mathematical structures that are defined  
by two partial orders, for which I use the symbols \trianglelefteq  
and \preceq. Since these two symbols often occur closely together, I  
found it a little distracting that the eq-parts of the two symbols  
appear at different heights. Therefore, I prepared the following  
patch against mnsymbol, which moves the eq-line of the \preceq symbol  
to the same y-axis as the eq-line of the \trianglelefteq-Symbol (and  
the \leq symbol).

     Best,
     Marco

Oh dear -- I completely forgot to say thanks to Achim, who pointed me  
at the right lines for the change. Thanks!

Adobe Acrobat cannot find words containing ligatures (fi, fl, etc...)
with its built-in search function in a document using MinionPro rc3
package. Does anybody knows how to correct this issue? I'm using
PDFLaTeX v1.30, but I've detected the same problem with ps2pdf. TIA,

Please have a look at the documentation, Section 7.
