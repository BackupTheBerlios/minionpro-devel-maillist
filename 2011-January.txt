The problem with more recent versions of typetools is that the glyph
names in glyphlist.txt changed. One needs to update all the encoding
files in the "enc" directory to use the new names. (For instance
/lscript became /lsquare.)

As far as I can see, this just happened in the later versions (>2.83). 
The error I described is connected to the changes from 2.69 to 2.70 and 
is still present in =2.83. It is connected to the letters rho1, beta1 
etc. Removing most of these *1 letters solves the problem. However, not 
all systems seem to have the problem but all of mine. So far, I was not 
able to indentify the cause.

I assume that in addition to the changed glyph names in >2.83, the *1 
problem would also be present so I did not look at these versions any 
further.

Cheers
Sebastian

If I remember correctly, it was version 2.70 or 2.71 I looked at.
Apparently, the names of /rho1 and /beta1 were changed too.
(If I remember correctly, lcdf typetools, at least the old versions,
switched /phi and /phi1. Perhaps newer versions undid this switching
again.)
I still think that the way to fix this is to find out what the current
names of the glyphs according to glyphtext.txt are and to change the
enc-files accordingly.

I checked texglyphlist.txt of different versions. Until 2.83, there is no 
difference from 2.69:

schubert at linux-88bh:~/temp> diff lcdf-typetools-2.69/texglyphlist.txt 
lcdf-typetools-2.70/texglyphlist.txt 
schubert at linux-88bh:~/temp> diff lcdf-typetools-2.69/texglyphlist.txt 
lcdf-typetools-2.71/texglyphlist.txt 
schubert at linux-88bh:~/temp> diff lcdf-typetools-2.69/texglyphlist.txt 
lcdf-typetools-2.72/texglyphlist.txt 
schubert at linux-88bh:~/temp> diff lcdf-typetools-2.69/texglyphlist.txt 
lcdf-typetools-2.73/texglyphlist.txt 
schubert at linux-88bh:~/temp> diff lcdf-typetools-2.69/texglyphlist.txt 
lcdf-typetools-2.79/texglyphlist.txt 
schubert at linux-88bh:~/temp> diff lcdf-typetools-2.69/texglyphlist.txt 
lcdf-typetools-2.83/texglyphlist.txt 
schubert at linux-88bh:~/temp> diff lcdf-typetools-2.69/texglyphlist.txt 
lcdf-typetools-2.86/texglyphlist.txt 
1c1
< # lcdf-typetools texglyphlist.txt, Version 2.33
---
> # lcdf-typetools texglyphlist.txt, Version 2.84
9,18c9,15
< # FFsmall, FFIsmall, FFLsmall, FIsmall, FLsmall: invalid Unicode
...

Furthermore, I had look for rho in the sources, I just found it in 
t1reencode/t1reencode.cc (next to glyphlist.txt and texglyphlist.txt). 
As far as I can see, the difference between 2.69 and 2.70 in that file is 
not connected to renaming the glyphs but just another function for 
comparing strings. I guess I have to look at the differences in the code 
of the typetools in detail to find the problem...

Cheers
Sebastian

[Problem with scripts not working with lcdf >=2.70]

Well, without doing anything, it works again with lcdf typetools 2.85 and 2.86!


So there is still one issue: the \jmath does only create a black blob.
The lcdfj pfb and tfm is available. The map file includes a line about
these. Any idea where to start searching for reasons?

This is still open.

Solved with some clarification and advice of Andreas.

Thanks
